# Moving-whale
DAY-04 Of learning front end development

A production-ready, dependency-free 3D-style animated scene demonstrating motion design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Overview
Moving Whale is a small interactive demo that showcases:
- Layered CSS shapes, gradients and 3D transforms for a “low-poly” look
- Swim animation using `requestAnimationFrame` (speed control, direction toggle, wrap-around)
- Responsive layout and accessible structure suitable for portfolio use or embedding

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — visual styles, transforms and keyframes
- `script.js` — animation loop, controls and event handling

## Features
- Speed slider to control swimming speed
- Reverse button to flip direction
- Reset button to return to default state
- Lightweight, zero dependencies — ideal for GitHub Pages
